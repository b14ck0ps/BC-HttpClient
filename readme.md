# Business Central API Data Integration Project

## Project Description

This project is designed to create a Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central (BC) project that facilitates the retrieval of data from an external API endpoint and inserts this data into a Business Central table. Business Central is a powerful business management solution, and this project allows you to seamlessly integrate external data into your BC environment.

### Features

1. **API Integration:** This project provides the capability to connect to an external API endpoint. You can easily configure the API endpoint URL and authentication parameters to retrieve data.

2. **Data Transformation:** The retrieved data from the API can be transformed as needed to match the structure of the BC table. This project includes data transformation logic to ensure compatibility.

3. **Data Insertion:** Once the data is retrieved and transformed, it is inserted into the designated Business Central table. The project automates this process to ensure data consistency and accuracy.
